Currently this code has not been tested
Gps_reader.py:
This file will allow the gps module GY-NEO6MV2 to connect to the raspberry pi using UART(Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)

It has not been tested and may require fine tuning before deployment in the field

Before use the commands to download the required dependencies are 
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install pynmea2

Testing command:
python3 gps_reader.py

The code reads NMEA sentences over /dev/serial0 (Piâ€™s UART interface).

It parses $GPGGA and $GPRMC sentences using the pynmea2 library to extract timestamp, latitude, and longitude.

Gps_movement.py:
The gps movement file is a feature to trigger a notification if movement has been detected by the module
The movement will be measured in meters as there may be slight movements due to environmental forces
It uses the Havershine formula to measure and detected distance moved.

This has not been tested and is a potential concept which should be implemented in the gps_reader.py file

Some of it's features are:
Read latitude and longitude every few seconds.

Calculate the distance between the current location and the previous location.

If the distance exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 2 meters), movement is detected.
